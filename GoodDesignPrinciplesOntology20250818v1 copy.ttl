Core classes in the ontology include Design Principle (GDPO0000003), which is modeled as a directive information content entity that prescribes qualities and constraints for design practice. Good Design (GDPO0000001) represents the normative ideal of design according to Rams’ framework. Design (GDPO0000002) functions as the general class under which principles and practices are organized.

Each of Rams’ ten principles is represented as a distinct class under Design Principle:

1) Design Innovativeness – Good design is innovative.
2) Design Usefulness – Good design makes a product useful.
3) Design Aesthetic Quality – Good design is aesthetic.
4) Design Understandability – Good design makes a product understandable.
5) Design Unobtrusiveness – Good design is unobtrusive.
6) Design Honesty – Good design is honest.
7) Design Durability – Good design is long lasting.
8) Design Thoroughness – Good design is thorough down to the last detail.
9) Design Environmental Friendliness – Good design is environmentally friendly.
10) Design Minimalism – Good design is as little design as possible.

All ten principles are modeled as directive information content entities (DICE), which means they prescribe norms or constraints that design processes should follow. These classes are linked upward to Good Design, providing a unifying node for reasoning about Rams’ philosophy as a whole. Subclass axioms connect each principle to either qualities (such as aesthetic quality or durability) or roles and processes (such as understandability or usefulness)."""@en ;

Having joined Braun in 1955, where he would contribute to over 500 products across four decades, Rams became increasingly concerned with the lack of clarity, honesty, and functionality in design practices of the time. Influenced by his grandfather, a carpenter, Rams sought a philosophy of design that balanced innovation with restraint.

His critical question—What constitutes “good design”?—led to the development of the Ten Principles of Good Design, a framework that has shaped generations of designers and organizations worldwide. These principles emphasize that design should be innovative, useful, aesthetic, understandable, unobtrusive, honest, durable, thorough, environmentally friendly, and minimal. Together, they embody his famous maxim “Less, but better.”

Rams’ principles not only guided Braun’s product legacy but also profoundly influenced Apple’s design philosophy, particularly under Chief Designer Jonathan Ive. The enduring relevance of Rams’ work demonstrates how ontological clarity about design principles can support both historical reflection and contemporary practice."""@en ;

The ontology enables modeling of how design principles prescribe, constrain, and evaluate design processes and artifacts.

Each design principle is modeled as prescriptive, guiding design processes or constraining design decisions. For example, Design Innovativeness prescribes some innovation process, while Design Environmental Friendliness prescribes alignment with sustainability processes.

Principles can be linked to artifacts (designed products) as the bearers of the qualities emphasized by Rams. For example, Design Aesthetic Quality is about some product form, while Design Usefulness is about some artifact function.

The ontology can also be used for evaluation and annotation. Principles can serve as annotation points in assessing whether a product conforms to one or more aspects of good design. For example, a Braun SK4 record player may be annotated as conforming to Design Minimalism and Design Usefulness, while an iPhone may be annotated as conforming to Design Aesthetic Quality and Design Understandability.

Applications of the Ontology

This ontology can be used for design evaluation, enabling structured assessment of products or prototypes against Rams’ principles. It can support historical analysis by comparing design philosophies across time, such as mapping Rams’ principles against Apple’s design language or contemporary sustainability standards. It can also be used pedagogically, teaching design students how abstract principles are represented ontologically and applied to real-world cases. Finally, it can be integrated into digital design tools, where it can guide concept generation and ensure conformity with the principles of good design.

The Good Design Principles Ontology (GDPO) preserves and formalizes the intellectual legacy of Dieter Rams, transforming his Ten Principles into machine-readable and logically coherent entities. By aligning with BFO 2020 and CCO 2.0, the ontology ensures interoperability with broader knowledge ecosystems, enabling designers, historians, educators, and technologists to apply Rams’ vision systematically.

This ontology is not only a representation of Rams’ philosophy but also a living framework for modeling and evaluating design practices, ensuring that good design—innovative, useful, beautiful, honest, and sustainable—remains an enduring ideal."""@en .
